Group Hands On Activity 1 
Create a simple calculator that processes or manipulates two variables:
Create an Interface named Calc that has a single abstract method named compute(). This method takes an array of integers.


Create a class called: MainEntry. In this class, implement the compute() method four times by using blocks to add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Then ask the user to enter a series of numbers, and ask what they would like to do with the numbers. In the case of compute()divide, only allow for two numbers.

Hint: Use Generics
